Soften butter. If you are planning on making these, take the butter out of the fridge first thing in the morning so it’s ready to go when you need it.
Measure the flour correctly. Be sure to use a measuring cup made for dry ingredients (NOT a pyrex liquid measuring cup). There has been some controversy 
on how to measure flour. I personally use the scoop and shake method and always have (gasp)! It’s easier and I have never had that method fail me.  Many of you say that the only way to measure flour is to scoop it into the measuring cup and level with a knife. I say, measure it the way you always do. Just make sure that the dough matches the consistency of the dough in the photos in this post.

DO NOT over-bake these chocolate chip cookies! I explain this more below, but these chocolate chip cookies will not look done when
 you pull them out of the oven, and that is GOOD.
